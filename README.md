**W-PHP Resizer** is a PHP 5.4+ compatible class that allows you to easily resize images. This class provides various options for resizing, cropping, and saving images.

## Installation

To use this class, simply include the `resizer.php` file in your project.

## Usage

### Initialize the Class

```php
include 'resizer.php';
$resizeObj = new resize('path/to/your/image.jpg');
```

Here, `path/to/your/image.jpg` specifies the path to the image you want to resize.

### Resize Image
The `resizeImage()` method resizes the image to the specified dimensions and option.
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage($newWidth, $newHeight, $option);
```
- `$newWidth:` Target width (pixels).
- `$newHeight:` Target height (pixels).
- `$option:` Resizing option (see options below).

### Resizing Options
`'exact':` Fits the image exactly to the specified dimensions, compressing the image if necessary.
`'portrait':` Resizes the image based on the specified height, adjusting the width proportionally.
`'landscape':` Resizes the image based on the specified width, adjusting the height proportionally.
`'auto':` Automatically resizes the image to the specified dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio.
`'crop':` Resizes the image by cropping it to the specified dimensions.

### Save Image
The `saveImage()` method saves the resized image to the specified path and quality.
```php
$resizeObj->saveImage($savePath, $imageQuality);
```
- `$savePath:` Path and name of the image to be saved.
- `$imageQuality:` Quality for JPEG and PNG images (0-100, default 100).
## Example Usages

### Landscape Resizing
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage(200, 200, 'landscape');
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized-landscape.jpg', 100);
echo '<img src="sample-resized-landscape.jpg"></img><p>';
```

### Portrait Resizing
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage(200, 200, 'portrait');
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized-portrait.jpg', 100);
echo '<img src="sample-resized-portrait.jpg"></img><p>';
```

### Auto Resizing
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage(200, 200, 'auto');
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized-auto.jpg', 100);
echo '<img src="sample-resized-auto.jpg"></img><p>';
```

### Exact Resizing (Compression)
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage(200, 200, 'exact');
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized-exact.jpg', 100);
echo '<img src="sample-resized-exact.jpg"></img><p>';
```

### Crop Resizing
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage(200, 200, 'crop');
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized-crop.jpg', 100);
echo '<img src="sample-resized-crop.jpg"></img><p>';
```

##Detailed Examples

### Saving with Different Qualities
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage(300, 300, 'auto');
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized-low-quality.jpg', 50); // Low quality
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized-high-quality.jpg', 90); // High quality
```

### Saving to Different File Types
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage(150, 150, 'crop');
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized.png', 75); // Save as PNG
$resizeObj->saveImage('sample-resized.gif'); // Save as GIF
```

### Resizing While Maintaining Aspect Ratio
```php
$resizeObj->resizeImage(500, 300, 'auto'); // Resize width to 500 while maintaining aspect ratio
$resizeObj->resizeImage(300, 500, 'auto'); // Resize height to 500 while maintaining aspect ratio
```

## Error Handling
The class does not return errors for invalid file types or incorrect file paths. However, the `openImage()` method returns `false` for an invalid file type or path. Therefore, it's recommended to check the file type and path before performing file upload and resizing operations.
```php
$resizeObj = new resize('invalid_file.txt');
// $resizeObj->image is false if file couldn't be opened.
```
## Dependencies
This class depends on PHP's GD library. Make sure the GD library is enabled.
